Whispers of New England Autumn

In New England's embrace, as summer fades,
Where forests wear their vibrant shades,
Amber and gold, in the cool autumn light,
Dance with the wind, a spectacular sight.

Crimson and russet, the leaves gently fall,
Painting a tapestry over all,
A rustling carpet under the trees,
Whispering tales in the autumn breeze.

Maples and oaks, in splendid array,
Celebrate harvest in their own way,
Each leaf a story, a memory dear,
Echoing joys of the passing year.

As daylight wanes and nights grow cold,
The leaves in New England boldly unfold,
A fleeting beauty, so vivid, so brief,
In each fallen leaf, there's a belief.

In the heart of New England, the autumn thrives,
A spectacle of nature, it revives,
The essence of life, in every hue,
A New England autumn, forever true.
